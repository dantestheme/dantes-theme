## Introduction

[Dracua](https://draculatheme.com/) is well-known dark theme for many users.

Dracula theme is overall feel is good to me. But there are a few points that I didn't like and wanted to improve.  
That's why this project - Dantes - was born.

## Why Dracula?

- Able to use for many apps
- Its colors are really go well with its name

## Why Not Dracula?

- Its colors are not that dark as it is dark theme.
- Also its visibility is not that good.

[Almost 100 themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=dracula&target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Relevance) are maded that it inspired or fork from Dracula. I think these things show that Dracula is already nice theme. But also many users have some points that they didn't like or want to improve it. So Dantes aim to satisfy those demand.

## So Why Dantes?

![vscode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87603390/146216846-d20f21eb-6445-4d50-be83-fd2940b26da1.png)

### Comparing with Dracula

#### It's literally darker

I think Dracula is quite bright. Dark theme make text have higher contrast. So being darker than Dracula is close to the properties of dark theme.

#### But also keep dracula's features

Dantes is basically based and inspired on Dracula theme. And I also refered to the Dracual theme, when I make Dantes. So the structure are quite similar with Dracula. So the users who love the Dracula and its features also can use Dantes as they did.

### Comparing with Monte Cristo (before renewal)

![rm3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87603390/146216461-a261d85f-9b30-4ffa-9a99-91abb0a64378.png)

In previous version, the Monte Cristo have [some problems](https://github.com/dantestheme/dantes-theme/issues/1). So I [renew the color palette](https://github.com/dantestheme/dantes-theme/issues/2) for that reason.

So Dantes improved these two problem that Monte Cristo have - Bad visibility & Too much high contrast

#### Better visibility

The main color of Monte Cristo is 'Violet' ðŸŸª So it caused bad visibility. [Because the color Violet is with a short wavelength and it closes to the blue scheme.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_(color)) And also violet is not that go well with other dark theme.

**Now** the main color of Dantes is 'Dark Green' ðŸŸ© So now Dante has better visibility. [Because green is restul to the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green#Color_vision_and_colorimetry)

#### Better contrast

As I said, I think Dracula theme's colors are not that dark. So I change the bright colors are more brighter and the dark colors more darker. But it caused that the whole colors had strong contrast and too vivid.

**Now** Dantes have better contrast. I try to make color paletter that it have to less contrast than before, but also have to vivid and clear.
